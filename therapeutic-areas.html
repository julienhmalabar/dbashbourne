								<p>Pain can be described as “an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage”, in other words, an uncomfortable feeling and/or unpleasant sensation that may or may not be related to an injury.</p>
								<p>Pain can begin suddenly or come about slowly over time and can be classified as acute or chronic.
								Acute (short-term) pain is usually caused by a specific disease or injury and may last from moments to weeks or even months. Treatment of acute pain is aimed at treating the underlying injury and interrupting the pain signals to the brain.
								Chronic (long-term) pain may be regarded as a disease state in itself, the cause may not be known or well understood, and it sometimes results in pain-related disabilities.</p>

								<p>Pain is always subjective. For this reason, the experience of pain and therefore its management, is unique to every individual.</p>

								<h3>Pain: a daily experience for millions of people in the UK</h3>
								<p>It is estimated that 14 million people in the UK live with chronic pain. There are a number of treatment approaches and medicines that can be employed to help with the management of pain, which vary according to the specific diagnosis.</p>
								<p>There are also several pain management societies, associations and patient charities who can help with support and information for people in pain and their carers, such as the British Pain Society’s “Understanding and managing long-term pain – information for people in pain”.</p>

						        <h3>What is Parkinson's disease?</h3>
								<p>Parkinson’s is a progressive neurological disorder related to a loss of nerve cells in a specific part of the brain. These nerve cells are responsible for producing a chemical called dopamine. When there is not enough dopamine in the body, it becomes difficult to control movements and move smoothly.</p>
								<p>Symptoms differ from one person to the next and some of the more well-known or common outward symptoms include shaking or trembling, slowness of movement, and stiffness. However, there may be many other less obvious symptoms affecting quality of life, such as pain, depression, memory problems, sleep problems, difficulty swallowing, speech problems, bladder/bowel problems, and fatigue.</p>

								<h3>Parkinson’s affects thousands of people in the UK</h3>
								<p>Every hour, someone in the UK is told they have Parkinson’s disease. It is estimated that around 130,000 people in the UK are living with Parkinson’s disease, and more than 10 million people are affected worldwide.</p>
								<p>Parkinson’s is more common in older people (>75 years) but can also affect younger people (< 50 years), and it tends to occur more often in men than in women.</p>
								<p>Parkinson’s can usually be well controlled using a combination of drugs and other therapies, but as the condition progresses, treatment needs to be adapted and an increased amount of care and support may be required.</p>
								<p>There are also several Parkinson’s websites and patient charities who can help with support and information for people with Parkinson’s and their carers, such as Parkinson’s UK (www.parkinsons.org.uk )</p>
