						        <h3>What is pain ?</h3>
								<p>Pain can be described as “an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage”, in other words, an uncomfortable feeling and/or unpleasant sensation that may or may not be related to an injury.</p>
								<p>Pain can begin suddenly or come about slowly over time and can be classified as acute or chronic.
								Acute (short-term) pain is usually caused by a specific disease or injury and may last from moments to weeks or even months. Treatment of acute pain is aimed at treating the underlying injury and interrupting the pain signals to the brain.
								Chronic (long-term) pain may be regarded as a disease state in itself, the cause may not be known or well understood, and it sometimes results in pain-related disabilities.</p>

								<p>Pain is always subjective. For this reason, the experience of pain and therefore its management, is unique to every individual.</p>

								<h3>Pain: a daily experience for millions of people in the UK</h3>
								<p>It is estimated that 14 million people in the UK live with chronic pain. There are a number of treatment approaches and medicines that can be employed to help with the management of pain, which vary according to the specific diagnosis.</p>
								<p>There are also several pain management societies, associations and patient charities who can help with support and information for people in pain and their carers, such as the British Pain Society’s “Understanding and managing long-term pain – information for people in pain”.</p>
